# Handwritten-mathematical-equation-recognizer

## Abstract
Recognition of handwritten text has been a prominent problem in the field
of image processing and recognition of handwritten mathematical equations is
even more challenging due to a large variety of mathematical symbols and the
complex structures of the equations. Also, mathematical equations are used in
all kinds of scientific studies and by using a calculating software we can solve
these equations easily and quickly with no errors. There are various kinds of
software present online that detect mathematical equations written using a digital 
pen on the go. But there might be people who do not have access to a
digital pen. To the best of our knowledge, there are no software present online
that detect handwritten mathematical equations containing subscripts and 
superscripts by taking their images as input and predicting their corresponding
notations.

In this project, we made a model that can process an image of a handwritten 
mathematical equation containing subscripts and superscripts, captured by
a suitable sensor, recognise the equation and form the corresponding digital
form of the equation. This digital form can be used as an input to various
computational software.
